# Breaking Bread (working title: Middleground)

## About the Project

Our team had a 24 hour hackathon to build a proof-of-concept for an app. We used NextJS and Bootstrap to design an app that connects users with different political views in a 1:1 environment.

After reading articles on the same subject, users then connect to discuss the topic and learn together. Hopefully, some common ground is found along the way!
